==========================

Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn:

-   how to segment an image by Gradient structure tensor (GST)

Theory
------


Result
------

Below you can see input anisotropic image.

Below you can see segmentation result. The result was completed by W = 53, THR = 0.43, Angle = [35...57].

You can also find a quick video demonstration of GST using on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/SJq6j3i0oWM).
